## Multi-Class Texture Analysis In Colorectal Cancer Histology


### Introduction
Multi-class texture analysis in colorectal cancer histology
Automatic recognition of different tissue types in histological images is an essential part in the digital pathology toolbox. Texture analysis is commonly used to address this problem; mainly in the context of estimating the tumour/stroma ratio on histological samples.
In this paper we present a new dataset of 5,000 histological images of human colorectal cancer including eight different types of tissue.
We used this set to assess the classification performance of a wide range of texture descriptors and classification.
Dataset Anonymized H&E stained CRC tissue slides were obtained from the pathology archive at the University Medical Center Mannheim (Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany).

### Train set
Label name of category and 625 non-overlapping tissue for each label tiles of dimension 150X150 px 

### Test set
Ten anonymized H&E stained CRC tissue 5000X5000 px

### Categories
Eight categories of cells:

(a) tumour epithelium,

(b) simple stroma,

(c) complex stroma (stroma that contains single tumour cells and/or single immune cells),

(d) immune cell conglomerates,

(e) debris and mucus,

(f) mucosal glands,

(g) adipose tissue,

(h) background.
